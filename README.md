# Digital Image Processing Tool

# 1. Introduction

**The project has reached the completion of its staged development but this markdown file is still being edited and not all content has been completed yet.**

This project was an auxiliary tool I developed as an image processing engineer, utilizing my free time. Although the company I worked for was equipped with the professional image processing and analysis software Matrox Inspector 7.0, I could not access its API and thus turned to OpenCV for development. The primary purpose of this auxiliary tool was to test and evaluate the effectiveness of OpenCV's image-processing capabilities. Additionally, this tool integrated the APIs of industrial cameras from IDS and SENTECH, aiding in the real-time acquisition of image data.

The latest version of the application boasted a wealth of image-processing functions, including dilation, erosion, filtering, image segmentation, and video compression. When I left the company and handed over my responsibilities to my successor, I left this tool with them. Unfortunately, I forgot to update the latest version on my GitHub, resulting in only the initial version of the project being available here. In the future, when I have spare time, I plan not only to update this tool but also to further enhance its features to surpass its previous best version.

# 2. Functionality 

The following is an example of finding feature contours through digital image processing technology in this auxiliary tool. **(More explaination will be updated soon)**
